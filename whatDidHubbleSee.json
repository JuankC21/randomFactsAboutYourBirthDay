    "December 20": "These stars belong to the globular cluster M15. Nestled among them is an astronomical oddity. The pinkish object to the upper left of the cluster's core is a gas cloud surrounding a dying star. Known as Kuestner 648, this was the first planetary nebula found in a globular cluster.",

    "December 27": "This picture shows the inner region of NGC 2976, located roughly 11 million light-years away in the constellation Ursa Major. Despite the lack of well-defined arms visible in this image, NGC 2976 is a spiral galaxy.",
    "December 28": "This image captures the irregular dwarf galaxy I Zwicky 18 and a companion galaxy to its upper right. The two galaxies are interacting, triggering star formation in I Zwicky 18.",
    "December 29": "In NGC 3603, thousands of sparkling, young stars are nestled within a giant nebula. This stellar \"jewel box\" is one of the most massive young star clusters in our Milky Way galaxy.",
    "December 30": "This close-up shows four of the five galaxies that make up Stephan’s Quintet. The image reveals bright, blue clusters of stars, born from the violent interactions between some of the member galaxies.",
    "December 31": "The arms of the \"grand design\" spiral galaxy M81 are filled with young, bluish, hot stars. The greenish regions in the image are bright, gaseous clouds where new stars are forming."
